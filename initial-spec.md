# Pharaoh: Game Specification

**Pharaoh** is a turn-based economic simulation game for the classic Macintosh,
written by Robert Martin (v1.2). The player assumes the role of a disinherited
noble who must, within 40 years, build a kingdom from nothing and erect a great
pyramid.

---

## Objective

Starting with only borrowed capital, the player must acquire land, slaves,
oxen, and horses; manage an agricultural economy; and construct a pyramid to a
target height before time expires. The target height depends on difficulty
level:

| Level    | Pyramid Height | Min Credit Limit | World Growth |
|----------|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| Easy     | 100 ft        | 5,000,000 gold   | 15%/yr       |
| Moderate | 300 ft        | 500,000 gold     | 10%/yr       |
| Hard     | 1,000 ft      | 50,000 gold      | 5%/yr        |

## Screen Layout

The screen is a 10-column by 25-row grid of labeled cells organized into
framed, titled sections. The default window size is 1024x768 pixels; cell
dimensions scale proportionally so the layout adapts to different window
sizes. The background is white with black text; font sizes scale with the
cell height. Light gray horizontal lines separate the rows within each
section for readability. Below is a wireframe:

```
+--Col 0---Col 1---Col 2---Col 3-+--Col 4---Col 5-+--Col 6---Col 7-+--Col 8---Col 9-+

## Dialog Wireframes

All dialogs overlay the main game screen. There are two dialog types:
**action dialogs** (buy/sell, feed, loan, overseer, plant, spread, pyramid, contracts)
and **face message dialogs** (neighbor visits, idle messages, dunning notices).

### Action Dialog

Action dialogs appear as a rounded-corner rectangle spanning grid cells
(2, 8) through (7, 12) — 6 columns wide by 5 rows tall. Each dialog has
an icon image on the left, a title line, an amount input field, and
clickable radio buttons (for mode-selecting dialogs) plus OK/Cancel
action buttons at the bottom.

**Mode-selecting dialogs** (Buy-Sell, Loan, Overseer):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                           |
|  +--------+  buy-sell wheat (w) [buy]                     |
|  |        |                                               |
|  | [icon] |  Amount: [________500________]                |
|  |        |                                               |
|  +--------+  (o) Buy (b)  ( ) Sell (s)  [OK] [Cancel]    |
|                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Simple dialogs** (Feed, Plant, Spread, Pyramid):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                           |
|  +--------+  feed slaves (S)                              |
|  |        |                                               |
|  | [icon] |  Amount: [________3.5________]                |
|  |        |                                               |
|  +--------+  [OK (Enter)]  [Cancel (Esc)]                 |
|                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Layout details:**

- The icon occupies approximately 40% of the dialog height, positioned at
  the top-left with 8px insets.
- The title appears to the right of the icon, using the title font size.
  It includes the dialog type, commodity name (if applicable), keyboard
  shortcut in parentheses, and current mode in brackets.
- The amount input field appears below the title at approximately 3x the
  value font size from the top. The input value is displayed inside a
  bordered text edit box (white fill, gray stroke, corner radius 3)
  positioned after the "Amount:" label with ~4px left padding.
- Radio buttons and action buttons appear at `btn-y = y + h - 20 -
  title-size - 8`, height = `title-size`. Mode-selecting dialogs show
  two radios (x+8 w110, x+126 w110) then OK (x+264 w110) and Cancel
  (x+382 w120). Simple dialogs show OK (x+8 w120) and Cancel (x+136
  w120).
- The background is light blue-white (RGB 245, 245, 255) with a gray
  stroke (RGB 100) at weight 2, corner radius 5.

### Face Message Dialog

Face message dialogs appear when a neighbor delivers a message (idle pep
talk, chat/advice visit, or dunning notice). They display as a
rounded-corner rectangle spanning grid cells (1, 8) through (8, 11) —
8 columns wide by 4 rows tall.

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                  |
|  +-----------+  Your oxen look well-fed. Keep                    |
|  |           |  feeding the oxen like that.                      |
|  |  [face    |  Fine looking oxen you've got.                    |
|  |  portrait]|                                                   |
|  |           |                                                   |
|  +-----------+                                    [press any key]|
|                                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Layout details:**

- The face portrait occupies approximately 70% of the dialog height,
  positioned at the left with 10px inset. The portrait is centered
  vertically within the dialog.
- The message text appears to the right of the portrait with 12px
  spacing. Text wraps within the remaining width (dialog width minus
  portrait width minus margins).
- The text uses the value font size with 1.3x line leading for
  readability.
- A `[press any key]` hint appears at the bottom-right of the dialog
  in gray, using the small font size.
- The background is light blue-white (RGB 245, 245, 255) with a gray
  stroke (RGB 100) at weight 2, corner radius 5.
- Pressing any key dismisses the dialog. The key press is consumed and
  not forwarded to other game actions.

**Face portraits:**

| Face | File | Image | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `resources/faces/man1.png` | ![Man 1](resources/faces/man1.png) | Afro man with goatee and open jacket |
| 1 | `resources/faces/man2.png` | ![Man 2](resources/faces/man2.png) | Bearded man in plaid shirt |
| 2 | `resources/faces/man3.png` | ![Man 3](resources/faces/man3.png) | Man with goatee in bow tie and suit |
| 3 | `resources/faces/man4.png` | ![Man 4](resources/faces/man4.png) | Man with glasses and necktie |

At game start, faces 0-3 are randomly assigned to the four personality
roles (Good Guy, Bad Guy, Village Idiot, Banker). The face message dialog
always uses the assigned face for the delivering neighbor.

### Event Message Dialog

When a random event occurs during a month, the event narration is displayed
as a face message dialog after the month simulation completes. A random
neighbor portrait (face 0-3) delivers the news. The player must press any
key to dismiss the event message before continuing.

Events that trigger popups: Locusts, Plagues, Acts of God, Acts of Mobs,
War, Revolt, Workload, Health Events, Labor Event, Wheat Event, Gold Event,
Economy Event. Each has a pool of narration templates (see Messages section).

### Contracts Dialog

The contracts dialog appears as a rounded-corner rectangle spanning grid cells
(2, 5) through (8, 18) — 7 columns wide by 14 rows tall. It has two modes:

**Browsing mode:** Shows a scrollable list of available contract offers. Each
line shows: player name, BUY/SELL, amount, commodity, price, and duration.
The currently highlighted offer has a light blue background. Up/Down arrows
navigate, Enter selects the highlighted offer, Esc closes the dialog.

**Confirming mode:** Shows a confirmation prompt: "Will you buy/sell [amount]
[commodity] from/to [player] for [price] gold in [duration] months?"
Press y to accept (moves the offer to pending contracts), n or Esc to reject
and return to browsing mode.

### Difficulty Selection Screen

Before gameplay begins, the player sees a full-screen difficulty selection
screen. This screen replaces the main game grid until a choice is made.
Background is dark blue (RGB 30, 30, 60). All text is centered horizontally.

```

### Dialog Interaction Model

Both dialog types block all other input while displayed:

1. **Action dialogs** capture all keystrokes. Typing digits and `.`
   appends to the input field. Backspace deletes the last character.
   Mode-selection keys (`b`/`s` for buy/sell, `h`/`f` for overseer,
   `b`/`r` for loan) switch the dialog mode. Enter executes the action.
   Esc cancels and closes the dialog. Invalid input or missing mode
   selection produces an error message (string, not face dialog) that
   is cleared on the next key press.

2. **Face message dialogs** are dismissed by pressing any key. While a
   face message is showing, the game loop skips all visit timer checks
   (no new messages can appear until the current one is dismissed). The
   visit timers continue running in the background.

3. **Priority:** When both a dialog and a face message exist, the dialog
   takes visual priority. The face message persists in state until
   dismissed. Visit timer checks are suppressed whenever either a dialog
   or a face message is active.

## Formulae

All formulae below use the following random distributions:

- **uniform(a, b)** -- Uniform on [a, b).
- **gaussian(mean, sigma)** -- Normal distribution, mean and standard
  deviation.
- **absGaussian(mean, sigma)** -- Gaussian clamped to non-negative values.
- **exponential(mean)** -- Exponential distribution with the given mean.
- **lookup(x, table)** -- Piecewise-linear interpolation over an 11-point
  table mapping an input range to output values.

### Planting Cycle

Land progresses monthly through four stages:

    Fallow --> Planted --> Growing --> Ripe --> Harvested (back to Fallow)

Each acre supports approximately 20 bushels of seed. June and July plantings
yield the best harvests; January plantings yield the worst. The seasonal
modifier is applied via `lookup(month, seasonalYieldTable)`.

### Manure Production

For every 100 bushels of wheat eaten by livestock and slaves, approximately
1 ton of manure is produced:

    manureMade = wheatEaten / 100 * absGaussian(1.0, 0.1)

### Wheat Yield

Determined by the fertilizer-to-land ratio and a seasonal multiplier:

    wheatYield = lookup(manurePerAcre, yieldTable)
                 * absGaussian(1.0, 0.1)
                 * lookup(month, seasonalYieldTable)

### Workload

Monthly required work (in man-hours per day) is:

    requiredWork = oxen * 1
                 + manureToSpread * 64
                 + landToSow * 30
                 + landPlanted * 20
                 + landGrowing * 15
                 + wheatRipe * 0.1
                 + landRipe * 20
                 + horses * 1
                 + pyramidQuota * avgPyramidHeight * 12
                 + temporaryWorkAddition

The total is then randomized by `absGaussian(1.0, 0.1)`.

### Slave Output

Maximum work a single slave can produce:

    maxWorkPerSlave = motivation * workAbility * oxenMultiplier

where:

    motivation       = positiveMotivation + negativeMotivation
    positiveMotivation = lookup(overseerEffPerSlave, positiveMotiveTable)
    negativeMotivation = lookup(lashRate, negativeMotiveTable)
    workAbility      = lookup(slaveHealth, workAbilityTable)
    oxenMultiplier   = max(lookup(oxenPerSlave, oxMultTable) * oxenEfficiency, 1)

### Slave Efficiency

If slaves cannot meet the workload, all activities are proportionally reduced:

    slaveEfficiency = totalWorkDone / requiredWork     (capped at 1.0)

When efficiency < 1, every activity (planting, harvesting, feeding, pyramid
construction) is scaled by this fraction.

### Overseer Stress

When work goes unfinished, overseers accumulate pressure:

    stress  = min(1, workDeficitPerSlave / 10)     (if deficit > 0)
    relaxation = overseerPressure * 0.3            (if no deficit)
    overseerPressure += stress - relaxation

Stressed overseers lash slaves:

    lashRate = lookup(overseerPressure, stressLashTable)
               * overseerEffPerSlave

Lashing increases short-term slave output but causes sickness and accelerated
death.

### Health

Slave, oxen, and horse health are each tracked on a 0-to-1 scale. Each month:

    healthDelta = nourishment - sicknessRate

where nourishment comes from feeding (via lookup tables), and sickness comes
from overwork and lashing (via lookup tables). Death and birth rates for each
population are interpolated from health. Selling sick livestock yields reduced
prices (sale price is scaled by health).

### Pyramid Geometry

The pyramid is modeled as a 2D equilateral triangle. Each stone is one unit
of area.

    maxHeight = (sqrt(3) / 2) * base
    height    = (base - sqrt(base^2 - 4 * area / sqrt(3))) / (2 / sqrt(3))

The base is fixed at game start by difficulty level:

| Level    | Base (stones) | Max Height |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Easy     | 115.47        | ~100 ft    |
| Moderate | 346.41        | ~300 ft    |
| Hard     | 1154.70       | ~1000 ft   |

The game is won when `height + 1 > maxHeight`.

### Monthly Costs

    gold -= overseers * overseerSalary
    gold -= (totalLand*100 + slaves*10 + horses*5 + oxen*3)
            * (absGaussian(0.7, 0.3) + 0.3)
    gold -= avgPyramidHeight * stonesAdded
    gold -= loanBalance * (interestRate + interestSurcharge) / 100

### Market Prices

Prices undergo monthly random inflation:

    inflation += gaussian(0.0, 0.001)
    price *= absGaussian(1 + inflation, 0.02)

Prices are also subject to supply and demand. The global economy simulation
runs each month for every commodity:

    demand *= 1 + (worldGrowth / 12)
    monthlyDemand = demand / 12
    supply -= monthlyDemand * 0.8

    if supply < 0:
        price      *= uniform(1.0, 1.2)
        production *= uniform(1.0, 1.1)

    supply -= monthlyDemand * 0.2
    supply = max(0, supply)

    if supply > 0:
        price      *= uniform(0.8, 1.0)
        production *= uniform(0.9, 1.0)

    production *= uniform(0.95, 1.05)
    supply += production / 12

If the player overproduces a commodity, global supply rises and prices fall.
If the player becomes a major consumer, demand outstrips supply and prices
rise.

The market also has finite capacity: attempting to sell more than the market
can absorb (supply exceeds 110% of demand) is refused. Attempting to buy more
than available supply is capped.

### Credit and Loans

Net worth determines borrowing capacity:

    netWorth = slaves*slavePrice + oxen*oxenPrice + horses*horsePrice
             + totalLand*landPrice + manure*manurePrice + wheat*wheatPrice
             + gold

    creditLimit = realNetWorth * creditRating

(where `realNetWorth` discounts livestock by health when recalculated for
credit checks).

The bank forecloses if `loan/netWorth` exceeds a threshold interpolated from
the credit rating. Regular payments improve credit rating; missed payments
degrade it. Running out of gold triggers an emergency loan at punitive rates;
failure to obtain one ends the game.

Credit rating adjustment on repayment uses an interpolation table indexed by
(payment / loanBalance), returning a multiplier between 1.0 and 1.3.

## Random Hazards

Each month there is a **1-in-8 chance** of a random event. When one occurs,
a value from 0 to 100 is drawn uniformly and the event is selected as follows:

| Range | Event            | Effect                                           |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0-1   | **Locusts**      | All planted, growing, and ripe land reverts to fallow. All crops destroyed. Heavy extra workload imposed. |
| 2-5   | **Plague**       | Health of all livestock multiplied by uniform(0.2, 0.9). Populations reduced by uniform(0.7, 0.95). |
| 6-7   | **Act of God**   | Fallow land, all crops, livestock, wheat stores, and manure each independently multiplied by uniform(0.3, 0.8). Massive extra workload imposed. |
| 8-19  | **Act of Mobs**  | Crops and livestock reduced by uniform(0.6, 0.8). Manure increases (the mob leaves a mess). Extra workload: uniform(5, 10) per slave + gaussian(5, 1) per acre. |
| 20    | **War**          | Outcome depends on overseer count vs. a randomly scaled enemy army. All commodities multiplied by `gain * absGaussian(1.0, 0.2)` where `gain = playerRoll / enemyRoll`. Losing a war can halve everything; winning can double it. Extra workload proportional to enemy army size. |
| 21-29 | **Slave Revolt** | Severity based on slave suffering (lash rate) and sickness. A "hatred" index is computed as `(suffering + sickness) / 2`, then interpolated into a destruction fraction (0 to 1). All commodities scaled by `(1 - destruction)`. Enormous extra workload: gaussian(18, 3) per slave + gaussian(30, 5) per overseer. |
| 30-44 | **Workload**     | A random extra labor burden is imposed: gaussian(10, 3) man-hours/day per slave + gaussian(8, 2) per acre of land. |
| 45-59 | **Health Event** | Health of all livestock multiplied by gaussian(0.6, 0.1). |
| 60-64 | **Labor Event**  | Overseers demand a raise of gaussian(20%, 5%). Some overseers quit (population multiplied by gaussian(0.9, 0.03)). Overseer stress increases by gaussian(0.5, 0.1). |
| 65-74 | **Wheat Event**  | Wheat stores and all growing crops reduced by approximately 30% (multiplied by gaussian(0.7, 0.07)). |
| 75-84 | **Gold Event**   | Gold reduced by approximately 35% (multiplied by gaussian(0.65, 0.1)). |
| 85-99 | **Economy Event**| All market prices randomly shocked (each multiplied by gaussian(1.0, 0.15), yielding up to ~15% swings in either direction). Inflation rate randomly perturbed. |

## Neighbors

Four AI neighbors provide commentary during gameplay. Their personalities are
shuffled at the start of each new game:

- **The Good Guy** -- Gives reliable advice about slave health, crop quality,
  and other conditions.
- **The Bad Guy** -- Deliberately gives misleading advice. Will commend the
  player's standing just before catastrophe.
- **The Village Idiot** -- Advice is randomly correct or incorrect.
- **The Banker** -- Visits with increasing frequency as the bank grows
  concerned about outstanding debt.

Each neighbor has a distinct face (portrait bitmap) extracted from the original
game's resource fork. The four portraits are stored as PNG files in
`resources/faces/man1.png` through `man4.png` (see Appendix A). At game start,
faces 0-3 are randomly assigned to the four personalities so that no two share
the same face. When a neighbor delivers a message, the message appears in a
dialog box overlaying the game screen with the neighbor's portrait displayed
alongside the message text.

Neighbors also deliver idle messages during periods of player inactivity and
occasionally drop in for "chats" containing hints or misdirection.

---

## Contracts

Neighboring kings offer contracts to buy or sell commodities outside the
normal market supply/demand system. Contracts specify:

- **Commodity** (wheat, slaves, oxen, horses, manure, or land)
- **Type** (buy or sell)
- **Quantity** (scaled to approximately 6x the player's current holdings,
  with a minimum floor of 200,000 / unit price)
- **Price** (quantity * unit price * (0.4 + exponential(0.6)))
- **Duration** (uniform 12 to 36 months)

Failure to fulfill a contract incurs a 10% penalty on the remaining contract
value. The counterparty may also default or partially fulfill their
obligations based on per-player probability traits (payment reliability,
shipping reliability, default probability), which are themselves randomized at
game start.

Contracts are offered via the Contracts menu, which refreshes each month.
Old contracts have a 20% chance of being replaced; contracts with fewer than
8 months remaining are always replaced. Aging buy-contracts increase in price
(multiplied by uniform(1.01, 1.1)); aging sell-contracts decrease (multiplied
by uniform(0.90, 0.99)).

### Contract Expiration

Contracts settle as a **lump sum when the duration expires** (months-left
reaches 0). Between acceptance and expiration, only default checks occur —
no goods or gold change hands until settlement.

**Each month per pending contract:**
1. Default check — if `uniform(0,1) < (1 - default-k)`, contract cancels;
   player receives 5% of `price * amount` as penalty payment.
2. Decrement months-left.
3. If months-left <= 0, settle:

**BUY settlement** (counterparty buys from player):
- Determine `can-buy`: full amount if pay-k check passes, else
  `amount * uniform(0.5, 0.95)`.
- If player has insufficient goods: deliver all available, receive payment
  at per-unit price, penalty 10% of remaining value deducted, commodity
  zeroed. Contract amount reduced; re-settles next month.
- If counterparty can't buy all: deliver `can-buy`, receive payment, bonus
  10% of remaining value. Contract amount reduced.
- Full buy: deliver all, receive `price * amount`. Contract deactivated.

**SELL settlement** (counterparty sells to player):
- Determine `can-sell`: full amount if ship-k check passes, else
  `amount * uniform(0.5, 0.95)`.
- If player has insufficient gold: penalty 10% of total value deducted,
  buy what remaining gold allows. Contract adjusted.
- If counterparty can't ship all: partial delivery, pay for delivered,
  bonus 10% of remaining. Contract adjusted.
- Full sell: pay `price * amount`, receive all goods. Contract deactivated.

**Livestock health blending:** When receiving livestock (slaves, oxen,
horses) via SELL contracts, the incoming animals have health 0.9. Blended
health = `(existing-health * existing-count + 0.9 * added) / (existing + added)`.

**Messages:** Each settlement outcome generates a face-message dialog
formatted as: "Regarding your contract with [name] for [amount] [commodity]:
[pool message]". The face portrait is `who mod 4`. Messages queue in
`:contract-msgs` and pop to `:message` one at a time — first after the
month simulation, then on each key dismiss.

---

## Messages

The game communicates through dialog alerts. Every message in the game is
spoken aloud using text-to-speech synthesis. Messages delivered by a neighbor
use that neighbor's voice settings (rate and pitch) and display the neighbor's
portrait in a dialog box (see Appendix A for portrait images); all other
messages (opening speeches, win/loss announcements, trading dialogs, input
errors, event narrations, etc.) use the default voice (rate 190, pitch 310)
and appear as a simple text bar. Each
message category has a pool of variant strings selected at random.

### Neighbor Advice Messages

Each of the 10 advice topics (oxen feeding, horse feeding, slave feeding,
overseers, stress, fertilizer, slave health, oxen health, horse health,
credit rating) has two pools of messages:

- **Good advice** (~6-15 variants) -- Compliments the player's management.
- **Bad advice** (~6-15 variants) -- Warns of poor conditions.

The good guy delivers the accurate pool; the bad guy delivers the inverted
pool; the village idiot randomly picks either; the banker never gives topical
advice. There is a 5% chance any advice is flipped regardless of personality.

### Generic Chat Messages

A pool of ~20 small-talk messages used when:
- The banker visits (he never gives topical advice).
- A 20% random chance overrides topical advice.
- The selected advice topic has no relevant resource (e.g., advising on
  oxen when the player has none).

Examples: "So, how ya doin there ol' buddy boy?", "Nice day, isn't it",
"Hey, how about those Crocks?"

### Idle Pep Talk Messages

A pool of ~50 messages delivered when the player is inactive for 60-90
seconds. These range from gentle prods to pop-culture references to absurd
humor. Examples: "Beam me up Scotty", "Boy are you ugly", "What did one
eye say to the other? There's something between us that smells."

### Dunning Notice Messages

A pool of ~40 loan-reminder messages delivered by the banker with escalating
severity. The frequency depends on credit rating (every 5 seconds for poor
credit, up to every 300 seconds for good credit). Messages range from polite
("May we respectfully remind you that you owe us some dough?") to
threatening ("Pay up your loan, or we'll break your legs") to absurd
("Olaf! Here boy.").

### Foreclosure Warning Messages

A pool of ~15 messages warning the player of imminent foreclosure when the
debt-to-asset ratio is dangerously high. These escalate from warnings to
game-over notices.

### Random Event Narration Messages

Each random event type has its own pool of narrative messages:

- **Acts of God** -- Descriptions assembled from adjective + disaster +
  consequence pools (e.g., "an incredibly large volcano devastated your
  property!").
- **Acts of Mobs** -- Assembled from crowd-size + motivation + action pools
  (e.g., "a huge crowd protesting animal abuse held a rock concert on your
  fields").
- **War** -- Win/loss messages with percentage outcomes.
- **Revolt** -- Descriptions of slave uprising with destruction percentage.
- **Health/Wheat/Gold/Economy** -- Each has ~5-10 narrative variants.
- **Locusts/Plagues** -- Brief destruction announcements.
- **Workload** -- Descriptions of extra labor demands with humorous premises.
- **Labor** -- Overseer raise demands and quit notices.

### Trading Dialog Messages

- **Supply limit** (~10 variants) -- When selling more than the market can
  absorb (e.g., "I am afraid I can't accept any more than %.0f.").
- **Demand limit** (~10 variants) -- When buying more than available supply.
- **Transaction success** (~10 variants) -- Confirming completed trades.
- **Insufficient funds** (~10 variants) -- When the player can't afford the
  purchase.

### Contract Messages

- **Counterparty default** (~8 variants) -- When the counterparty cancels.
- **Partial payment** (~8 variants) -- When the counterparty can't pay full
  amount this month.
- **Partial shipment** (~8 variants) -- When the counterparty can't deliver
  full amount.
- **Player insufficient goods** (~8 variants) -- When the player can't
  fulfill a sell contract.
- **Contract completion** (~15 variants each for buy and sell).

### Loan Messages

- **Credit check fee** (~10 variants) -- Informing the player of the cost
  to reassess credit.
- **Loan approval** (~15 variants) -- Confirming the loan with amount and
  interest rate.
- **Loan denial** (~15 variants) -- Gleefully rejecting the application.
- **Loan repayment** (~8 variants) -- Acknowledging full repayment.

### Input Error Messages

Each dialog (buy/sell, feed rate, planting, overseer, pyramid quota, loan)
has its own pool of ~5-10 humorous error messages for invalid input such as
non-numeric entries, negative values, or amounts exceeding available
resources.

### Opening Messages

A pool of ~20 speeches welcoming the player at game start, ranging from
solemn ("How high can you build your pyramid in 20 years") to humorous
("If you want to hear something clever, start the game over").

### Win Messages

A pool of ~10 congratulatory messages displayed when the pyramid reaches
target height, followed by ~5 farewell messages.

### Game Over Messages

A pool of ~10 messages for losing via foreclosure or bankruptcy, plus
~5 general farewell messages.

### Cash Shortage Messages

A pool of ~10 messages alerting the player when they run out of gold
during monthly costs, ranging from sympathetic to mocking.

### Overseer Messages

- **Missed payroll** (~8 variants) -- When the player can't pay overseers,
  they quit and demand a raise to return.
- **Raise demand** (~8 variants) -- Random event forcing an overseer pay
  increase.

---

## Random Number Distributions

The simulation employs four probability distributions:

- **uniform(a, b)** -- Uniformly distributed on [a, b). Implemented via the
  Coveyou quadratic congruential method.
- **gaussian(mean, sigma)** -- Normal distribution using the polar method
  (Box-Muller variant).
- **absGaussian(mean, sigma)** -- A Gaussian that resamples until a
  non-negative value is obtained.
- **exponential(mean)** -- Exponential distribution via inverse-transform
  sampling: `-ln(u) * mean` where `u` is uniform on (0, 1).

All interpolation uses piecewise linear tables with 11 points spanning a
defined input range. Values outside the range are clamped to the nearest
endpoint.

---

## Appendix A: Message Pools

All messages below are extracted from the original game resources. Messages
containing `%s`, `%d%%`, `%.0f`, or `%.2f%%` are format templates where the
game inserts values at runtime. Messages are selected at random from their
pool each time they are needed.

## Appendix B: Character Portraits

The four neighbor character portraits were extracted from the original Pharaoh
1.2 resource fork (PICT v1 resources). The original 1-bit bitmaps have been
scaled up 150% with bilinear interpolation for anti-aliased smoothing.

| File | Original | Scaled | Description |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `resources/faces/man1.png` | 76 x 94 | 114 x 141 | Afro man with goatee and open jacket |
| `resources/faces/man2.png` | 71 x 82 | 106 x 123 | Bearded man in plaid shirt |
| `resources/faces/man3.png` | 44 x 68 | 66 x 102 | Man with goatee in bow tie and suit |
| `resources/faces/man4.png` | 37 x 60 | 56 x 90 | Man with glasses and necktie |

### Man 1 — Afro man
![Man 1](resources/faces/man1.png)

A man with a large afro hairstyle and goatee, wearing an open jacket with
decorative buttons. His expressive, friendly appearance suits the Good Guy or
Village Idiot roles.

### Man 2 — Bearded man
![Man 2](resources/faces/man2.png)

A broad-shouldered man with a full beard and heavy brow, wearing a plaid
flannel shirt. His stern, no-nonsense look fits the Bad Guy or Banker roles.

### Man 3 — Bow-tie man
![Man 3](resources/faces/man3.png)

A dapper man with a pointed goatee, wearing a bow tie and formal suit jacket.
His sharp, sly expression suits the Bad Guy or Village Idiot roles.

### Man 4 — Glasses man
![Man 4](resources/faces/man4.png)

A clean-cut man with glasses and a necktie, carrying a professional demeanor.
His conservative, bookish appearance is a natural fit for the Banker role.

### Usage

At game startup the four portraits are loaded and randomly assigned to the
four neighbor personality roles (Good Guy, Bad Guy, Village Idiot, Banker) so
that each game has a different face-to-role mapping. When a neighbor delivers
a message — whether advice, contract offers, idle chatter, or banker
warnings — the message appears in a dialog box overlaying the game screen with
that neighbor's portrait displayed alongside the text. The message is also
spoken aloud via text-to-speech using voice settings (rate and pitch) specific
to that neighbor.

## Appendix C: Strategy Guide

### Opening Moves (Months 1-6)

Borrow up to the credit limit immediately. Starting capital is zero and
interest is unavoidable, so the loan must be put to work fast. Prioritize
purchases in this order:

1. **Slaves** -- Buy 100+. Slaves are the fundamental workforce. At health
   1.0 with oxen, each slave produces ~38 man-hours/month of work.
2. **Oxen** -- Buy 1 ox per 2 slaves. This gives a 3.0x work multiplier
   from the oxen table — the single biggest force multiplier in the game.
3. **Overseers** -- Hire immediately. Without overseers, slave motivation
   is near zero and no work gets done. Aim for 1 per 15 slaves (motive ~0.63).
   At 300 gold/month each they are expensive, but essential.
4. **Horses** -- Buy 1 per overseer. With well-fed horses (health 0.8+),
   horse efficiency is ~0.99, so one horse per overseer gives `hs_ov * hs_eff`
   ≈ 1.0, hitting maximum overseer effectiveness (0.997). A second horse
   per overseer is wasted — the table clamps at 1.0.
   Horses are cheap (100 gold each) but eat 50-60 bushels/month.
5. **Land** -- Buy 50-100 acres. Land costs 100 gold/acre/month in upkeep.
   In Easy mode, land is only 1,000 gold/acre.
6. **Manure** -- Buy 3-5 tons per acre you plan to plant. At 5 tons/acre,
   wheat yield is 200 bushels per bushel of seed — farming is extremely
   productive and is the primary wealth engine.

### Feed Rates

Feed rates are bushels of wheat per individual per month. The nourishment
lookup tables have diminishing returns -- spending more wheat beyond the
sweet spot wastes grain for negligible health gain. Below a threshold,
nourishment goes **negative** and health actively declines. Recommended rates:

| Population | Range   | Sweet Spot | Notes |
|------------|---------|------------|-------|
| Slaves     | 0-10    | **8-10**   | Nourishment 0.12-0.18. Below feed 3, nourishment is negative and health drops. |
| Oxen       | 0-100   | **70-80**  | Nourishment 0.09-0.10. Aging costs 0.05/mo, so net health gain +0.04-0.05. Below feed ~45, health declines. |
| Horses     | 0-75    | **50-60**  | Nourishment 0.09-0.10. Aging costs 0.08/mo, so net health gain +0.01-0.02. Below feed ~40, health declines. |

At health 1.0, birth rates are very high (slaves ~14%/mo, livestock ~7%/mo)
and death rates are minimal (slaves 0.2%/mo, livestock ~0.4-0.5%/mo).
Populations grow rapidly. Starving your workforce is a false economy —
replacing dead slaves costs far more than feeding live ones, and at low
health the death spiral accelerates quickly (death rate reaches 100% at
health 0).

### Key Ratios

| Ratio | Target | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Oxen per slave | **0.5** (1 ox per 2 slaves) | Work multiplier 3.0x. Going to 1:1 gives 4.0x but doubles oxen feed costs. |
| Overseers per slave | **1 per 15** | Motivation ~0.63. At 1:25, motivation drops to ~0.40. Without overseers, motivation is near zero — slaves do no work. |
| Horses per overseer | **1** | With well-fed horses (health 0.8+, efficiency ~0.99), one horse per overseer reaches max effectiveness (0.997). Unmounted overseers start at only 0.30. Extra horses are wasted — the table clamps at input 1.0. |
| Manure per acre | **3-5 tons** | Yield jumps from 20 bu/bu-seed (bare) to 100 (3 tons) to 200 (5 tons). Beyond 5 tons yield drops due to over-fertilization. |
| Assets to debt | **2:1 or better** | The bank forecloses when the loan-to-net-worth ratio exceeds a threshold. Keeping assets at twice your debt keeps the bank happy and your credit rating rising. |

### Planting Calendar

The seasonal yield multiplier peaks around June-July (~1.27x) and bottoms
out in January (0.2x). The yield is determined at planting time, not
harvest time. Land takes three months to progress from Planted to Ripe.
The optimal planting window is:

| Plant in | Ripe in   | Seasonal Yield |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| May      | August    | 0.93x          |
| June     | September | 1.27x (best)   |
| July     | October   | 1.27x (tied)   |

Avoid planting in October-February. A December planting yields only ~25%
of a June planting from the same land. Spread manure before planting for
maximum yield.

### Building the Economy (Months 6-18)

- **Farm aggressively.** At 5 tons/acre manure, each bushel of seed returns
  ~200 bushels (modified by seasonal yield). Farming is the primary wealth
  engine — 10 acres planted in June yields ~25,000+ bushels from only 200
  bushels of seed.
- Populations grow fast at health 1.0 (~14%/mo for slaves). By month 12,
  expect 100 slaves to reach 350-450. Scale overseers and oxen to match.
- Start paying down the loan when cash flow allows. Interest bleeds gold
  every month (0.5%/mo), and the Banker neighbor grows increasingly
  aggressive about collections.
- Take **sell contracts** selectively (you deliver wheat, they pay gold).
  Avoid buy contracts until you have cash reserves — the 5% default penalty
  is based on total contract price.

### Pyramid Strategy (Year 2+)

Each stone requires `avgPyramidHeight × 12` man-hours of slave labor per
month. With ~3,770 hours of work capacity for 100 slaves, there is room to
start a modest quota early:

- **Start low.** When the pyramid is short, stones are cheap to lay. A quota
  of 5-10 stones/month costs little labor early on.
- **Scale up gradually.** As height increases, each stone costs more labor.
  With the rapid population growth (~14%/mo for slaves at health 1.0), work
  capacity scales up quickly to match.
- **Watch slave efficiency.** If efficiency drops below 1.0, all activities
  (farming, harvesting, pyramid building) are proportionally reduced. An
  overambitious quota starves the farm, which starves the slaves, which
  collapses everything.
- **The pyramid is a year-10+ problem.** On Easy (~115 ft target), the fast
  population growth means a modest steady effort suffices. On Hard (~1,155
  ft), you need a massive industrial economy before serious building can
  begin.

### Sample Easy-Mode Starting Configuration

Below is a concrete first-month setup for Easy difficulty. The player
borrows from the 5,000,000-gold credit line and buys the following:

**Purchases (Month 1)**

| Item       | Qty    | Unit Price | Cost       |
|------------|-------:|----------:|-----------:|
| Land       |     80 |     1,000 |     80,000 |
| Slaves     |    100 |     1,000 |    100,000 |
| Oxen       |     50 |        90 |      4,500 |
| Horses     |      7 |       100 |        700 |
| Wheat      | 20,000 |        10 |    200,000 |
| Manure     |    400 |        20 |      8,000 |
| **Total**  |        |           | **393,200**|

Hire **7 overseers** at 300 gold/month each (2,100 gold/month).

**Starting gold: 40,000.** This covers approximately 3 months of total
expenses: overseer salary (2,100/mo), ownership costs (~9,185/mo), and
loan interest (~1,970/mo). Ownership costs are charged monthly at
`land×100 + slaves×10 + horses×5 + oxen×3` gold, multiplied by a
random factor averaging ~1.0. If gold goes negative before the
emergency loan tops it up, overseers quit and demand a raise.

**Feed Rates**

| Population | Rate (bu/mo) | Monthly Wheat | Rationale |
|------------|-------------:|--------------:|-----------|
| Slaves     |           10 |         1,000 | Nourishment 0.18; health stays at 1.0 |
| Oxen       |           70 |         3,500 | Nourishment 0.09; offsets 0.05 aging, health oscillates 0.95-1.0 |
| Horses     |           55 |           385 | Nourishment 0.09; offsets 0.08 aging, health oscillates 0.92-1.0 |
| **Total**  |              |     **4,885** | Plus ~5% wheat rot per month |

The 20,000-bushel wheat stockpile provides roughly 4 months of runway
before the player must buy more wheat or harvest a crop.

**Spread & Plant — Start Farming Immediately**

| Setting          | Value | Notes |
|------------------|------:|-------|
| Manure to spread |    50 | 50 tons on 10 acres = 5 tons/acre |
| Acres to plant   |    10 | Start small; scale up as population grows |

With 100 slaves at health 1.0, total work capacity is about **3,770 hours
per month** (20 hrs/day work ability × 0.63 motivation × 3.0 ox multiplier
× 100 slaves). Spreading 50 tons on 10 acres requires only 50×64 + 10×30
= 3,500 hours — within capacity. Plant in month 1, harvest in month 4.

At 5 tons/acre manure and seasonal yield ~0.72 (April), each bushel of seed
returns ~144 bushels. With 20 bu/acre seed on 10 acres = 200 bu invested,
expect ~28,800 bushels harvested in month 4 — a massive return that more
than covers monthly feed costs.

**Pyramid Quota:** 0 stones/month initially. Start 5-10 stones/month once
farming income stabilizes (around month 4-6).

**Resulting Ratios and Health Targets**

| Indicator             | Value          | Neighbor Rating  |
|-----------------------|----------------|:----------------:|
| Slave feed rate       | 10 bu/mo       | Good (> 8)       |
| Oxen feed rate        | 70 bu/mo       | Neutral (good > 80, bad < 50) |
| Horse feed rate       | 55 bu/mo       | Neutral (good > 65, bad < 40) |
| Slaves per overseer   | 100/7 ≈ 14     | Good (< 15)      |
| Horses per overseer   | 7/7 = 1        | Max effectiveness (0.997) with well-fed horses |
| Overseer pressure     | ~0.0           | Good (< 0.2)     |
| Slave health          | 1.0 (stable)   | Excellent         |
| Oxen health           | oscillates 0.95-1.0 | Good         |
| Horse health          | oscillates 0.92-1.0 | Good (avg ~0.96) |
| Credit rating         | 1.0 (starting) | Good (> 0.8)     |
| Loan                  | ~393,200       | Small vs 5M limit |

Oxen and horse feed rates are set below the neighbor "good" thresholds to
conserve wheat. At 70 and 55 respectively, nourishment still exceeds the
aging penalty (0.05/mo for oxen, 0.08/mo for horses), so health recovers
each month after the aging drop. Raise rates to 85 and 70 once wheat
reserves allow, for smoother health oscillation.

**Understanding the Wheat Economy**

Farming in Pharaoh is **extremely productive**. The yield formula
(`wheat_harvested = yield_multiplier × seed_invested`) returns many times
the seed invested — at 5 tons/acre manure and a June planting (peak
season), each bushel of seed produces ~254 bushels. Even a modest 10-acre
plot returns thousands of bushels per harvest cycle.

The economy runs on **farming plus trading**:

- **Farming.** The primary wealth engine. 10 acres at 5 tons/acre manure
  and June planting returns ~25,000+ bushels from 200 bushels of seed.
  Scale up acreage as the workforce grows.
- **Livestock breeding.** At health 1.0, slave birth rates (~14%/mo) far
  exceed death rates (~0.2%/mo). Populations compound rapidly: 100 slaves
  grow to 350-450 in 12 months. Oxen and horses grow at ~6.5%/mo net.
- **Contracts.** Sell contracts pay gold for wheat deliveries to neighbors.
- **Rising prices.** Easy-mode world growth (15%/yr) inflates commodity
  prices, increasing net worth and credit headroom.
- **The credit line.** With 5M available and a 394,000 starting loan, there
  is ample room to finance expenses while the farm ramps up.

**The player should buy wheat monthly until the first harvest.** The
20,000-bushel starting stockpile plus the first farming harvest (month 4)
should sustain the economy. After that, farming income rapidly makes the
player self-sufficient in wheat.

**Monthly Costs (approximate)**

- Wheat purchases: ~5,325 bu × 10 gold/bu ≈ 53,250 gold/mo (pre-harvest only)
- Ownership: (80×100 + 100×10 + 7×5 + 50×3) × ~1.0 ≈ 9,185 gold/mo
- Overseer salary: 2,100 gold/mo
- Interest: 394,000 × 0.5/100 ≈ 1,970 gold/mo
- **Total monthly burn:** ~66,505 gold/mo

After the first harvest (month 4), wheat purchases drop dramatically as
farming produces far more wheat than is consumed. The player should begin
paying down the loan and start a modest pyramid quota.

**Scaling Up Farming**

As the slave population grows (~14%/mo net at health 1.0), work capacity
scales proportionally. Increase farming acreage to match:

| Slaves | Capacity | Farming Scale | Notes |
|-------:|---------:|---------------|-------|
| 100    |   3,770  | 10 acres / 50 tons manure | First month, fits with ~940 hrs spare |
| 200    |   7,540  | 30 acres / 150 tons manure | By month ~5; scale overseers to 14 |
| 400    |  15,080  | 80 acres / 400 tons manure | By month ~10; use all land |

Work costs per farming cycle: manure spreading (64 hrs/ton) + sowing
(30 hrs/acre) + ongoing tending (20 hrs/acre for sewn land, 15 for
grown) + harvest (20 hrs/ripe acre). Hire more overseers as the slave
population grows to maintain a good slave-to-overseer ratio (< 15:1).
Manure per acre should be 3.5-7.0 for the neighbor "good" rating.

### What to Avoid

- **Horses before overseers.** Horses without overseers to ride them are
  just expensive mouths to feed.
- **Over-borrowing.** The credit limit shrinks if the bank loses confidence.
  Once your credit rating drops, it is slow to recover.
- **Ignoring random hazards.** Locusts, plagues, and wars can wipe out half
  your holdings overnight. Keep reserves of wheat and gold as a buffer. Don't
  run at 100% capacity with zero margin.
- **Overworking slaves.** When the workload exceeds slave capacity, overseers
  lash them. Lashing boosts short-term output but causes sickness and death,
  creating a death spiral of declining labor, more lashing, and eventual
  revolt.

### Proven Winning Strategy (Easy Mode, 37 Years)

The following strategy has been validated by an automated simulation test
(`easy_mode_sim_test.clj`) that builds the pyramid in 37 years on Easy
difficulty with seed 42. It demonstrates a complete path from startup to
victory.

**Phase 1: Bootstrap (Months 1-12)**

Start with the Easy-mode defaults (100 slaves, 50 oxen, 7 horses, 20,000
wheat, 80 acres, loan 393,200). Borrow 200,000 gold operating capital.

- Set overseers to `ceil(slaves / 15)`, minimum 7.
- Farm 10 acres per month with 50 tons manure (5 tons/acre).
- Sell wheat when stockpile > 15,000 and gold < 50,000.
- Buy wheat scaled to population: when stockpile < `slaves * feed_rate * 2`,
  buy up to `slaves * feed_rate * 3` bushels.
- Buy manure (200 tons) when reserves drop below 100.
- Do NOT build pyramid yet (quota = 0).
- Do NOT sell slaves. Let population grow naturally (~14%/mo at health 1.0).
- By month 12: ~488 slaves, 104 oxen, 15 horses, ~47,000 gold.

**Phase 2: Build (Months 13-440)**

- Set pyramid quota = 15 stones/month when sl-eff > 0.7 and slaves > 200
  and wheat > 3,000. Reduce to 5 when sl-eff 0.5-0.7. Stop building
  when sl-eff < 0.5 or wheat < 3,000.
- Sell excess slaves above 800 (up to 200/month). This is the primary
  income source: ~100 slaves/month at inflated prices.
- Buy oxen to maintain ox/slave ratio ~0.3 (up to 20/month when gold
  > 200,000). This keeps ox-mult at ~2.3x for work capacity.
- Buy horses to maintain ~2 per overseer (up to 10/month when gold
  > 200,000). This maximizes overseer effectiveness.
- Continue farming 10 acres/month with manure spreading.
- Buy wheat proportional to population (the critical fix: 900 slaves eat
  9,000 wheat/month; buying only 5,000 causes starvation crashes).
- Repay loan when gold > 200,000 (keep 100,000 reserve).

**Key Metrics at Victory (Year 37, Month 9)**

| Metric          | Value         |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Pyramid height  | 100.0 / 100.0 |
| Stones placed   | 5,776         |
| Net worth       | 2.36 billion  |
| Slaves          | 898           |
| Oxen            | 309           |
| Horses          | 128           |
| Gold            | 2.23 billion  |

**Why This Strategy Works**

1. **Population is the engine.** At 14%/mo birth rate, 100 slaves become
   ~900 in 2 years. Excess slaves sold above 800 generate income that
   scales with inflation.
2. **Wheat buying must scale with population.** The most common failure
   mode is starvation: 900 slaves eat 9,000 wheat/month, but fixed
   purchases of 5,000 cause famine, health collapse, and death spirals.
3. **Ox ratio drives capacity.** At ratio 0.3, ox-mult is ~2.3x vs 1.0x
   with no oxen. This is the difference between sl-eff 1.0 and sl-eff 0.4.
4. **Fixed quota of 15 is sustainable.** At height 80, 15 stones requires
   15 x 80 x 12 = 14,400 man-hours. With 900 slaves at capacity ~27
   hrs/slave, total capacity is ~24,300 hrs, leaving ~10,000 hrs for
   farming. sl-eff stays above 0.7 at all heights.
5. **Resilience to random events.** Plagues, acts-of-god, and gold events
   periodically devastate the economy. The strategy recovers by buying
   replacement slaves (when population < 200) and maintaining gold
   reserves > 100,000.

## Appendix D — Known Deviations from Original C Source

The following behaviors exist in the implementation but were not explicitly
documented in the original spec. They are preserved intentionally as they
match the original C game logic.

### D.1 Pharaoh as +1 Overseer

The slave-to-overseer ratio is calculated as `slaves / (overseers + 1)`.
The player character (the Pharaoh) counts as one overseer. This means even
with zero hired overseers, slaves are not completely unsupervised.

**Source:** `workload.clj:47` — `sl-ov (/ (:slaves state) (+ (:overseers state) 1))`

### D.2 Livestock Aging Penalties

Oxen lose 0.05 health per month and horses lose 0.08 health per month as a
base aging penalty, independent of feeding and nourishment. This aging only
applies when the animal population is non-zero (health > 0). Horses age
faster than oxen, reflecting their shorter working lifespan.

**Source:** `health.clj:24` (oxen 0.05), `health.clj:32` (horses 0.08)

### D.3 Wheat Rot

Stored wheat decays at a rate of 5% per month (`wt-rot-rt = 0.05`), with
slight random variance (Gaussian around 1.0 with sigma 0.1). The rot is
deducted **before** feeding and sowing calculations, meaning the player
must account for storage losses when planning wheat allocation.

**Source:** `state.clj:45` — `:wt-rot-rt 0.05`
**Source:** `planting.clj:34-35` — `wheat-rot` function

### D.4 Wheat Efficiency Cap

When total wheat demand (feeding + sowing) exceeds available wheat after
rot, all consumption is proportionally reduced by a wheat efficiency factor
`wt-eff = wheat-after-rot / total-demand`. This affects feed rates, sowing
rates, and all downstream calculations uniformly rather than prioritizing
any single use.

**Source:** `feeding.clj:20-37` — `apply-wheat-shortage` function

### D.5 Interest Rate Display Format

The spec's loan approval messages use `%.2f%%` format (two decimal places
for interest rate percentage). The implementation matches this format.

### D.6 Workload Event Message Format

The spec's workload event messages use `%s` template substitution for
man-hours values. The implementation formats the man-hours as `"%.0f
man-hours"` and substitutes into the template string.
