Feature: Neighbors
  The player has four AI neighbors who visit with messages.
  Each has a distinct personality: good guy, bad guy, village idiot, banker.
  Neighbors give advice on game state, but reliability varies by personality.
  They also deliver idle messages, dunning notices, and random chats.
  See initial-spec.md Messages section for message pool details.

  Background:
    Given the game is running

  # -----------------------------------------------------------
  # Neighbor Personalities
  # -----------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario: Four distinct personalities assigned at game start
    When the game begins
    Then four faces are assigned
    And one face is the banker
    And one face is the good guy (truth-sayer)
    And one face is the bad guy (liar)
    And one face is the village idiot
    And no two personalities share the same face
    And assignments are randomized each new game

  Scenario: Personalities are assigned using set-men
    When personalities are assigned from seed 42
    Then four faces are assigned
    And no two personalities share the same face

  # -----------------------------------------------------------
  # Advice System
  # -----------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario: The good guy gives accurate advice
    Given the good guy visits
    And slave health is below 0.6
    When he gives advice about slave health
    Then he says the slaves look bad (accurate)

  Scenario: The bad guy inverts advice
    Given the bad guy visits
    And slave health is below 0.6
    When he gives advice about slave health
    Then he says the slaves look great (inverted)

  Scenario: The village idiot gives random advice
    Given the village idiot visits
    And slave health is below 0.6
    When he gives advice about slave health
    Then he randomly says good or bad

  Scenario: The banker only makes small talk
    Given the banker visits for a chat
    Then he delivers generic chat messages
    And he never gives topical advice

  Scenario: 5% chance any neighbor flips accuracy
    Given any neighbor gives advice
    Then there is a 5% chance the advice meaning is inverted

  Scenario: 20% chance a chat is just small talk
    Given any neighbor visits
    Then there is a 20% chance the chat is generic regardless of game state

  Scenario: Good guy choose-chat returns accurate advice
    Given personalities are set with seed 42
    And the state has slaves 10 with sl-health 0.4
    When choose-chat is called 1000 times for the good guy
    Then the majority of slave-health advice is bad-sl-health

  Scenario: Bad guy choose-chat inverts advice
    Given personalities are set with seed 42
    And the state has slaves 10 with sl-health 0.4
    When choose-chat is called 1000 times for the bad guy
    Then the majority of slave-health advice is good-sl-health

  Scenario: Dumb guy choose-chat gives mixed advice
    Given personalities are set with seed 42
    And the state has slaves 10 with sl-health 0.4
    When choose-chat is called 2000 times for the dumb guy
    Then slave-health advice includes both good and bad

  Scenario: Banker choose-chat always returns chat
    Given personalities are set with seed 42
    When choose-chat is called 100 times for the banker
    Then every result is chat

  Scenario: Advice skipped if relevant resource is zero
    Given the topic is "oxen feeding"

  # Idle Messages
  # -----------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario: Idle message after inactivity
    Given the player has been inactive for 60-90 seconds
    When the idle timer fires

  Scenario: Banker sends dunning notices when loan exists
    Given the player has an outstanding loan
    When the dunning timer expires
    Then the banker delivers a loan payment reminder

    # High credit = rare notices (every 300 seconds)
